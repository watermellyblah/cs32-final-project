# cs32-final-project
My CS32 final project with Angel. 
Dream Project: How can we create a trivia game?

Subtasks:
(Need to first get the questions from somewhere. We want to create multiple genre of questions such as: Art history, sports, Harvard. (If this goes well we want to add more genres)
We need to create a server and a client to communicate with and to send the questions and answers choices
Need to create a random dictionary. Probably will need to use random.choice like in roshambo. 
Need to create a counter that gives points to every correct answer and set values for points according to difficulty (ie. 100, 200, 200, 400, 500).
Maybe a time limit to respond? Don't know how to create that right now.
Probably will not do and only do it if we finish the project early.

Main Computational Task for Final Project: 
Creating a server and client to communicate between to give/answer questions.
Obviously have questions that we make with answers.
After the communication works, we can count the number of questions and give points according to difficulty
.
